## Overview

This assignment involves loading various tables from the [Rebrickable](https://rebrickable.com/) website and conducting analysis on the data. Rebrickable is a valuable platform used to determine which LEGO sets can be built from existing sets and parts, as well as suggesting sets to purchase to complete missing parts for a new set.

## Data

The data has been directly downloaded from the Rebrickable website and includes files for the tables outlined in the schema. Students are tasked with reviewing the schema and understanding how the tables are interconnected. While there's no available data dictionary, understanding the data is achievable by reviewing the files, schema, and consulting Rebrickable's [Download](https://rebrickable.com/downloads/) page and [API](https://rebrickable.com/api/) documentation. It's crucial to utilize the files provided on Brightspace for this assignment and not to download new files from the Rebrickable website.

## Assignment: Lego Project

In this assignment, referred to as the Lego Project, students will develop functions to complete specific tasks. While these functions might not be necessary for independent projects, they serve the purpose of evaluating students' ability to select data using Pandas/Numpy, which is utilized in the automatic grading on CodeGrade. Additionally, students are encouraged to merge datasets as appropriate for each task. This enhances code clarity and efficiency, particularly when working with data across multiple tables. Merging datasets appropriately can simplify code, as demonstrated by the ability to create each function with only one line of code in this assignment. It's important to note that students may not use all tables provided; discerning which data to use is a crucial skill for a Data Scientist.

Upon completion, the notebook should be saved as `lego.ipynb` and submitted to CodeGrade for automatic grading.

## Note

<u>Show Work</u>

Demonstrating the steps taken to arrive at solutions is essential. Manual spot checks are conducted throughout the term to ensure integrity and discourage hardcoded answers. Failure to demonstrate the thought process can result in a lower grade.

For example, if the answer to Q1, the mean of a specific column, is 22:
